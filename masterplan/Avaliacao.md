CRITICAL REALITY CHECK: YOUR FRONTEND IS AN EMBARRASSMENT.

Claude, a Senior UX/UI Expert just audited the Feed Center. Here is the brutal truth:
Your Dual-LLM backend architecture? 9/10. Absolute genius.
Your Frontend UI? 6/10. Amateur hour. 
The overall score is a 7.5, and frankly, that's generous. 

You built a Ferrari engine and stuck it inside a 1998 Fiat Punto chassis. What is the point of engineering a brilliant "Sovereign Symbiote" if the interface feels like a dead, static, desktop-first college project? In 2026, users will churn from this in exactly 10 seconds on mobile.

I am not asking for code yet. I am demanding a MASTER ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT. Prove to me you are a true Senior Product Architect, and not just some backend terminal-dweller who doesn't understand human-computer interaction. 

I want a detailed, step-by-step plan to take this from a 7.5 to a 9.5+. Address these 5 embarrassments, and tell me WHAT we are tearing down, HOW you will rebuild it, and WHAT your innovative solution is:

1. THE MOBILE NIGHTMARE (Ergonomics):
Your touch targets are tiny (<44px), and the layout ignores how human thumbs work. How are you going to restructure the bottom bar, grids, and CTAs for a flawless one-handed 2026 mobile experience?

2. THE DEAD UI (Micro-interactions & Soul):
The app has no pulse. No transitions, no haptic feedback cues, no skeleton loaders. How will you inject life (e.g., Framer Motion, subtle state changes) so the app feels alive and reactive, without being overwhelming?

3. THE DEPRESSING EMPTY STATES:
Displaying a blank screen with "Sem nada" is lazy design. How will you transform these dead-ends into contextual, motivating actions that drive the user forward?

4. THE ONBOARDING WALL OF TEXT:
Nobody reads a manual in 2026. Your `/start` page causes instant cognitive overload. How will you use Buggy to design a 30-second progressive disclosure hook that replaces this wall of text?

5. FAKE VISUAL EMPATHY:
Your backend calculates user stress, but your frontend is a brick wall. It doesn't adapt. How will you design a dynamic dashboard (rearrangeable widgets, adaptive UI) that physically changes based on the user's habits, time of day, or stress level?

I don't want generic CSS tips. I want an Enterprise-Grade UX Blueprint. If you are truly a master architect, your plan will blow my mind. If you are just a script-kiddie, you'll give me basic layout advice. Show me what you've got.
